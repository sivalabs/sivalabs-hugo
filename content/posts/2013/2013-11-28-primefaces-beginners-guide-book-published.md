I am glad to announce that my second book PrimeFaces Beginner's Guide is published.

As many of us know PrimeFaces is leading JSF component library for JSF based web applications. This PrimeFaces Beginner's Guide book targets the Java developers with basic knowledge on JSF and jQuery and covers most of the commonly used PrimeFaces components.

> Good news is that PrimeFaces Beginner's Guide book covers the latest PrimeFaces 4.0 version features such as Client Side Validations (CSV) framework: Dialog Framework, Search Expressions, Sticky Component and many other enhancement as well.

I would like to thank Packt Publishers for giving me an opportunity to write PrimeFaces Beginners Guide book. Especially I would like to thank Joanne Fitzpatrick, Kranti Berde, Ritika Dewani for their continuous support throughout writing process.
  
Also I would like to thank the reviewers Thomas Andraschko, Mauricio Fenoglio, Sudheer Jonna and Nilesh Namdeo Mali for their great support in catching up mistakes/typos and provided lot of ideas for improving the quality of content. In fact I learned a lot from the reviewers comments ðŸ™‚

I hope readers will enjoy reading this book ðŸ™‚
