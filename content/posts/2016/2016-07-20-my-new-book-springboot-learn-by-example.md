### What is SpringBoot?

Spring is one of the most popular Java frameworks out there to build web and enterprise application.
  
Spring supports variety of configuration approaches (XML, Annotations, JavaConfig etc) and properly configuring Spring applications become a bit tedious and repetitive process. To avoid these problems Spring team introduced SpringBoot to address the complexity of configuring Spring application.

SpringBoot is an opinionated approach to configure Spring based applications. SpringBoot automatically configures the application components based on various criteria like the jars you have on classpath, beans you have already configured, properties configured etc which makes it very easy to get up and running quickly.

I strongly believe that **the best way to learn or teach is by using examples.** This book is filled with plenty of examples explaining the concepts  in step by step manner.

### Who this book is for?

If you are looking for a fast paced guide to learn how to build Spring based applications using SpringBoot this book is for you!!.

If you are a Spring developer but haven't get your hands on SpringBoot and you feel like I know the drill, just tell me how to do it in SpringBoot way..this books is what you are looking for!!!

If you are just starting to use SpringBoot and it is working great but it all looks magical and you want to understand how SpringBoot works behind the scenes..this book will definitely be helpful to you!!

If you are a seasoned Spring developer with good grasp of Spring framework concepts and you just want a fast-paced guide to learn SpringBoot quickly..sure..this book is definitely for you!!

I see lot of people asking **‚ÄúWhat is the difference between SpringMVC and SpringBoot?‚Äù**, **‚ÄúShould I use SpringBoot or SpringMVC for my next web application?‚Äù** etc etc. See [Here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29479814/spring-mvc-or-spring-boot), [Here](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-Spring-Boot-and-the-Spring-framework) and [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/4mw91b/spring_mvc_vs_spring_boot/) . The short answer is **SpringBoot is nothing but Spring only..but it helps you a lot to build Spring based applications quickly.** The next question would be **How?**. The best way to explain it is by creating an application **WITHOUT SpringBoot** and show how quickly you can develop the same application **WITH SpringBoot**.

This book explains how normally we build Spring application without SpringBoot and shows how we can build the same application using SpringBoot in much easier way so that you can correlate the concepts and see how SpringBoot increases developer productivity.

SpringBoot does so many things behind the scenes to automatically configure the application. This book explains how SpringBoot AutoConfiguration works behind the scenes in very detailed manner and show how we can create our own AutoConfiguration as well.
