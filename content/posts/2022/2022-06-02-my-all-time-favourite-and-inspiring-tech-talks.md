We, software developers, aspire to become better by learning new tools and techniques.
In addition to that, I find listening to the experts and learning from their experiences is a great way to upskill ourselves.

We may want to learn a new technology, or want to start our own start-up company or learn why some hyped technologies failed.
Also, we may want to learn some behavioural aspects like how to be empathetic to others, be a better mentor to juniors etc.

I listen to a lot of tech talks by some awesome technologists and try to learn from them.
Here I would like to share some of my all-time favourite talks with you in this article.
