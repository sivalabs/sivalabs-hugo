I have been using Windows operating system from the beginning. When I first started using computer Windows XP was the latest operating system and it was amazing. After few years I started my career as a Java developer and in my office also I have been using Windows only.
  
After few years Windows Vista got released and I suffered with it for few months and then Microsoft released Windows 7 which is the best Windows operating system IMO. And then they released Windows 8 which I don't like much. Recently they released Windows 10 and I have upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Windows 10 is certainly better than Windows 8 but it still sucks compared to Windows 7.

I think the main reason for the popularity of Windows operating systems is the familiarity of the same look and feel of their all operating systems and they changed it (in a horrible way).

Few years ago I got to learn a bit about Linux in order to deploy my application on remote deployment servers and I used to get it done using few comments and I never really bothered to learn Linux. A year ago one of my friend suggested to look at Ubuntu which is a Linux OS with a nice Desktop Environment (DE). I installed Ubuntu on VirtualBox and played with it couple of days and left it because it was too slow on my VirtualBox.

## Why I want to lean and use Linux as my primary desktop OS?

  * These days I am spending good amount of time deploying apps on remote Linux servers, so I need to learn more about Linux.
  * I don't like Windows 8,8.1,10 OS mobile style desktop UI. I want my good old familiar Windows 7 style GUI. I came to know there are some Linux distros which looks like Windows 7.
  * I am really bored working on same Java technologies like Spring, JPA, JavaEE etc for almost 8 years and I wanted to tinker with something new and interesting.
  * It is free, no viruses and customizability etc.

Once I decided to use Linux as my desktop OS, I started looking for the better Desktop Linux distros for beginners like me and I found that following are better among the hundreds of Linux distros.

  * Ubuntu <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com" target="_blank">http://www.ubuntu.com</a>
  * Linux Mint <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com" target="_blank">http://www.linuxmint.com</a>
  * Fedora <a href="https://getfedora.org" target="_blank">https://getfedora.org</a>
  * CentOS <a href="https://www.centos.org" target="_blank">https://www.centos.org</a>
  * ElementaryOS <a href="http://elementary.io" target="_blank">http://elementary.io</a>
  * PinguyOS <a href="http://pinguyos.com" target="_blank">http://pinguyos.com</a>
  * OpenSUSE <a href="https://www.opensuse.org" target="_blank">https://www.opensuse.org</a>
  * Zorin <a href="http://zorinos.com" target="_blank">http://zorinos.com</a>
  
    and many more...

I have installed all of them on my VirtualBox to see which one is best. After trying all of them I settled on Linux Mint.

**Ubuntu** is the most popular desktop Linux distro but I didn't like its Unity Desktop Environment very much. But there are various other variation of Desktop Environments like GNOME, MATE which looks better, IMHO.

**Fedora** is Redhat's play ground for Redhat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and **CentOS** is a kind of open source version of RHEL built by community. Both Fedora and CentOS looks good but they are ass friendly as Ubuntu based distros for beginners.

**ElementaryOS** is the most beautiful OS among all the distros I have tried. It is a very light weight distro with fantastic look and minimal applications installed. If you are a casual user who uses your computer just for internet browsing, watching videos, play music, write some documentation then it is the best choice.

**PinguyOS**, which is a Ubuntu derivative, is a perfect distor for those who want everything to be pre-installed. It has most of the commonly used applications installed already. But it is too heavy and slow also.

I have tried **OpenSUSE**, **Zorin**, **Deepin**, **Bodhi**, **Manjaro** etc also and they are good.

And finally, my favorite is **Linux Mint**. Linux Mint is a Ubuntu derivative but with its own Desktop Environment called Cinnamon. Linux Mint also comes with other Desktop Environments like MATE, XFCE etc.
  
Linux Mint Cinnamon GUI looks almost like Windows 7 and the kind of customizations it provides is awesome. I liked Linux Mint very much among all the distros I tried and finally installed it on my laptop using it as my primary OS.

## **Don't I need Windows OS anymore?**

  * Even though there are plenty of Linux Desktop Environments with different GUI styles with good looks, I feel they are not even close to Windows 7 GUI.
  * Linux distros comes with lot of free applications and you can find thousands of free apps on the app stores, but there are few applications that runs only on Windows.
  * **Microsoft Office**: I know about LibreOffice and it is good, but honestly I feel it is not going to be a replacement for MS Office.
  * No official **OneDrive** client, no **RSA Secure Token ID** support, no **Photoshop**, gaming support is not as good as Windows and few more things like that.

I am not a Photoshop user, I am not a gaming person and I am not really heavy user of MS Office. So I can live with some limitations.

By using Linux OS I don't have to worry too much about viruses (I know Linux also can get viruses but not as much as Windows), thousands of free apps and it is free :-).

The best part of using Linux OS is I am understanding little bit more about how operating systems work.
