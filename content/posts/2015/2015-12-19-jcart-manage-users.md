In our previous post  <a href="http://sivalabs.in/jcart-manage-roles/" target="_blank">JCart: Manage Roles</a> we have seen how to list all roles, create new roles and update them.

Implementation of **Manage Users** also follows the same approach and very similar to the Implementation of Manage Roles. So I am not posting details of the implementation here again. Instead you can simply refer the code on JCart github repository <a href="https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart" target="_blank">https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart</a>.

If you have any questions regarding the implementation of Manage Users please post a comment.

With this we have Iteration-2 tasks completed. We will start on Iteration-3 soon. Stay tuned 🙂
