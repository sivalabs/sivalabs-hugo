Now that we have completed the most difficult part (writing Introduction to technical article series is much harder than you think!!), so let's start the fun part. **Coding**!!!

> **Note:** It is going to be a fast paced tutorial. Obviously we can't cover every little bit of all the technologies used in our application. So I would suggest to explore more on individual technologies like Spring, Thymeleaf on your own.

<span style="color: #0000ff;">I would strongly suggest to checkout the code from <a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart.git" target="_blank">https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart.git</a> if you want to see the complete code as we are going to trim the code snippets for brevity.</span>

We will start with Iteration-1 UseCases implementation, progressively building the JCart application.

As part of Iteration-1, we will be implementing the following UseCases:

  * [Initial Code Setup]({{< relref "2015-12-01-jcart-initial-code-setup.md" >}}) 
  * [Domain Modelling and Database Designing]({{< relref "2015-12-01-jcart-domain-modelling-and-database-designing.md" >}}) 
  * [Creating JPA Entities]({{< relref "2015-12-01-jcart-create-jpa-entities.md" >}}) 
  * [Admin UI Layout SetUp]({{< relref "2015-12-01-jcart-admin-ui-layout-setup.md" >}}) 
  * [Configuring Spring Security]({{< relref "2015-12-01-jcart-configuring-spring-security.md" >}}) 
  * [Email Service Setup]({{< relref "2015-12-06-jcart-email-service-setup.md" >}}) 
  * [Admin Forgot Password]({{< relref "2015-12-06-jcart-admin-forgot-password.md" >}}) 
  * [Admin Reset Password]({{< relref "2015-12-06-jcart-admin-reset-password.md" >}}) 
  * [Configuring HTTPS SSL/TLS]({{< relref "2015-12-07-jcart-configuring-https-ssltls.md" >}}) 
  * [Setting up Jenkins/SonarQube]({{< relref "2015-12-16-setting-up-jenkinssonarqube.md" >}})
