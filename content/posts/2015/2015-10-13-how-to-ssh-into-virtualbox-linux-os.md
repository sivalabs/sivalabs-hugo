While learning some of the Linux commands we may want to use SSH commands to login into a remote Linux system and we may not have a dedicated Linux system to play with.
  
In this post I will explain how I am using my Linux OS installed on VirtualBox to SSH from Windows OS.


### 1. Install **openssh-server** on Linux OS in VirtualBox
  
`sudo apt-get install openssh-server`

On some Linux distros (ex: Fedora) the openssh server won't start automatically.

You can enable it to start automatically using the following command:

`systemctl enable sshd.service`

Now you can restart the VM or start the service in the current session itself using

`systemctl start sshd.service`

**Shutdown your Linux VM if it is already running.**
  
Select Linux VM in Virtualbox and go to **Settings** -> **Network**.
  
In **Adapter 1** tab **Enable Network Adapter** is selected.
  
Go to **Adapter 2** tab and check **Enable Network Adapter**.
  
For **Attached To** option select **Host-only Adapter** and click OK.

Start your VirtualBox Linux VM
  
Open Terminal and run **ifconfig** command
  
`eth1 Link encap:Ethernet HWaddr 08:00:27:7e:ea:89`

`inet addr:192.168.56.101 Bcast:192.168.56.255 Mask:255.255.255.0`

`inet6 addr: fe80::a00:27ff:fe7e:ea89/64 Scope:Link`

Now from you Windows OS you can use Putty to connect to your Linux OS usinng SSH as follows:

`ssh username@192.168.56.101`

Enjoy ðŸ™‚
