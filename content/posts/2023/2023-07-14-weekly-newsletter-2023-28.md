## What I Learned This Week

* I have published [Tomato Architecture - A Pragmatic Approach to Software Design](https://sivalabs.in/tomato-architecture-pragmatic-approach-to-software-design/) article 
  sharing my thoughts around how to build an application without over-engineering it.
* I have shared [My Thoughts on DevOps, Platform Engineering, and FullStack Developer](https://sivalabs.in/my-thoughts-on-devops-platform-engineering-and-fullstack-developer/) 
  talking about the challenges of being a Fullstack Developer.
* Published a video on [Testing AWS Service Integrations using LocalStack and Testcontainers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPQEjpX-yio)
* [Tom Hombergs](https://twitter.com/TomHombergs) published the 2nd Edition of 
  [Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture: Build 'clean' applications with code examples in Java](https://www.amazon.in/Your-Hands-Dirty-Clean-Architecture/dp/180512837X/) book
  which I highly recommend to read.
* If you are working on Go projects, then the [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) tool comes really handy to have Live Reload upon code changes.
  You can see an example [application](https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/bookmarks-go).
* In recent years, a common approach being followed is building backend API and frontend as SPA separately.
  In some cases, though they are built as separate applications, they are bundled as single deployable 
  using [frontend-maven-plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin).
  Then I came across [Quinoa - A Quarkus extension to create Modern UI with no hassle](https://quarkus.io/blog/quinoa-modern-ui-with-no-hassle/).
  Looks very interesting to me.
* Spring 6.1 is introducing **RestClient** as an alternative to **RestTemplate** which provides the fluent API similar to Reactive **WebClient**.
  Read this [announcement](https://spring.io/blog/2023/07/13/new-in-spring-6-1-restclient) for more info.
