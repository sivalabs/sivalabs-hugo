It's been tough time for everyone due to the Corona virus situation. 
Staying at home for weeks and weeks is not easy, but it is very necessary thing to do so that we don't spread the virus.

However, if I look on the bright side I used to spend minimum 3 hours for office commute everyday.
Now I am using that time for various other activities including learning some new things.

### So, here is what I learned in the last week:

* I have published a new article on [How to Imposing Code Structure Guidelines using ArchUnit](https://sivalabs.in/2020/04/impose-architecture-guidelines-using-archunit/)

* I use **Spring Security JWT based authentication** for most of my personal projects. 
Instead of copy-pasting the same code again and again I created a [SpringBoot JWT Security Starter](https://github.com/sivalabs/spring-boot-jwt-security-starter)

* Though SpringBoot is very easy, understanding the internal working mechanism of it is a bit challenging and overwhelming.
**Marco Behler** published the following new articles covering Spring framework, SpringBoot and Spring Security 
and I highly recommend to read them.

    * [What is Spring Framework? From Dependency Injection to Web MVC](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-framework)
    * [What is Spring Boot? Autoconfigurations In-Depth](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-boot)
    * [Spring Security: Authentication and Authorization In-Depth](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/spring-security)

* If you are trying to learn **Deploying SpringBoot + SpringCloud Applications on Kubernetes** then 
I highly recommend this course https://udemy.com/course/kubernetes-crash-course-for-java-developers/ 
by **Ranga Karanam** [In28Minutes](https://twitter.com/In28Minutes). 
A very practical and hands-on course covering from basics to advanced topics.

* If your application is heavily relying upon **Spring ecosystem** you may also want to follow **Spring style coding/formatting standards**. 
In that case this [spring-javaformat-maven-plugin](https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat) might come handy.
Also, you can take a look at [Prettier Java](https://github.com/jhipster/prettier-java) by **JHipster** team.

We may not get the opportunity to work on many things in our official projects. 
For example, I never get a chance to setup **SSL/TLS certificates**, never worked on setting up **database cluster** etc.
Similarly I have some gray areas in some concepts like **OAuth**, **SQL query optimization** etc.
So, I thought of why not use this available time to brush up on these topics. 
I found the following wonderful resources to learn those concepts. 

### Database Query Optimization using EXPLAIN ANALYZE
* [The Postgres Performance Tuning Manual: Query Plans](https://blog.gojekengineering.com/the-postgres-performance-tuning-manual-query-plans-52a023c2342d)
* [Index Columns for LIKE in PostgreSQL](https://niallburkley.com/blog/index-columns-for-like-in-postgres/)
* [EXPLAIN documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/sql-explain.html)

### OAuth 2.0 & Open ID Connect
* [OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (in plain English)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=996OiexHze0)
* [Security Patterns for Microservice Architectures](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2020/03/23/microservice-security-patterns)

I would strongly suggest to read articles on [Okta Developer Blog](https://developer.okta.com/blog/) 
and subscribe to [OktaDev Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5AMiWqFVFxF1q9Ya1FuZ_Q) 
for learning about application security.

### Pluralsight Free April Month
Just in case you haven't already heard, **Pluralsight** is offering [**FREE ACCESS for April 2020 month**]((https://t.co/9Son2fPnwG?amp=1)).
Happy learning :-)
