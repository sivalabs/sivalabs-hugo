I come across many blog posts from various sources like [Twitter](https://twitter.com/sivalabs), 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) etc and some of them are very helpful. 
Also, in day to day work I learn few new things, explore some new tools. 
Usually I keep track of this information using **Browser Bookmarks** and [Pocket](https://app.getpocket.com/).

I thought may be this information could be useful for others too. So, I am going to share it weekly on my blog.

* If you are looking for a detailed and practical guide for implementing Microservices using SpringBoot then look no further 
[Java Microservices: A Practical Guide](https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/java-microservices-a-practical-guide)

* While using JPA how many times we want to see the generate SQL query with actual parameter values instead of placeholders?
We can use [p6spy-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/gavlyukovskiy/spring-boot-data-source-decorator) to log the generate SQL statements with actual parameters.

* I am surprised looking at how easy it is to create CLI tools using **NodeJS** and 
[inquirer.js](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js). 
At work, I have created a simple CLI tool to build and deploy SpringBoot applications on PCF in just couple of hours.
If you are interesting this is a great tutorial.

* If you are just starting out with **GitHub Actions** or thinking of migrating from **TravisCI** then 
[Continuous Integration of Java project with GitHub Actions](https://medium.com/faun/continuous-integration-of-java-project-with-github-actions-7a8a0e8246ef)

* If you are new to **Git** then this post is definitely a good starting point covering various concepts of Git with pictorial representation
[How to teach Git](https://rachelcarmena.github.io/2018/12/12/how-to-teach-git.html) 

* If your SpringBoot application is starting slowly on your MacOS then this post has a solution for you
[Fixing Slow Spring Boot Startup](https://blog.noizwaves.io/2017/09/02/slow-spring-boot-startup.html)

* **Docker** became part of day to day work and once in a while we want to clean up unnecessary stuff.
[How To Remove Docker Containers, Images, Volumes, and Networks](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-volumes-and-networks/)

* You might have heard about **Hexagonal Architecture** and is wondering how to implement it using Spring then this article is for you.
[Achieving framework-independent zen with the power of interfaces and hexagonal architecture](https://rskupnik.github.io/framework-independence-with-hexagonal-architecture)

* If you don't like **Setters and Getters** but you are using just because of Json to Object marshalling then this is for you.
[Deserialize Immutable Objects with Jackson](https://www.baeldung.com/jackson-deserialize-immutable-objects)

* If you have some time to burn and want to explore interesting tech stuff

Happy learning :-)
