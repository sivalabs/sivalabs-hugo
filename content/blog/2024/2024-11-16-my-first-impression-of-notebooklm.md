I came across [NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google/) from my social media feed, and it looks interesting.

With NotebookLM, you can upload documents, videos, web urls and let the AI agents talk about the uploaded material.
That sounds intriguing.

Recently I wrote an article about software complexity and shared my view point.
Many people appreciated it and some people didn't. That is fine to have different opinions.

I thought, lets see how NotebookLM interprets what I said.

So, I went to https://notebooklm.google/ and used the Webpage URL of my article
**Is Software Development Hard? Or, We are making it complicated?** (https://www.sivaprasadreddy.com/is-software-development-hard/)
as input.

First, it showed me the following Summary:

{{< figure src="/raw-images/software-complexity-notebooklm-summary.png" alt="software-complexity-notebooklm-summary" >}}

I am already spellbound looking at the summary.

I didn't expect that AI can summarize something so accurately.

A few minutes later, it generated the audio transcription of 2 AI agents talking about my article.

### Audio Transcript

{{< audio
path="audio/Is-Software-Development-Hard.mp3"

Listening to this audio, I was blown away.
I can only imagine two people can sit together and talk rationally, just like in this audio.

My first impression of NotebookLM is :heart_eyes:
