## SivaLabs Weekly Newsletter - 2023 Week 27

* I came to know about [T3 App](https://create.t3.gg/) which claims to be **"The best way to start a full-stack, typesafe Next.js app"**
* Also, came across [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) which is **"Open Source backend for your next SaaS and Mobile app in 1 file"**
* Switched from **iTerm2** to [warp Terminal](https://www.warp.dev/), and I am liking it very much.
* I have written [Sharing Thoughts and Knowledge via Twitter vs Blogging](https://www.sivalabs.in/sharing-thoughts-and-knowledge-via-twitter-vs-blogging/) article.
* Published a new blog post [Running Testcontainers tests using GitHub Actions and Testcontainers Cloud](https://www.atomicjar.com/2023/06/running-testcontainers-tests-using-github-actions/). Try it out by creating a Free Testcontainers Cloud account.
* If you want to master testing Spring Boot applications and prefer reading a book over watching videos, then I highly recommend [Testing Spring Boot Applications Demystified](https://leanpub.com/testing-spring-boot-applications-demystified)
* Though I said **"I decided Go is not my cup of tea and decided to move on"** in [My Plans for 2023](https://www.sivalabs.in/my-plans-for-2023/), for some reason I needed to brush up my Go skills. 
  As part of that, I have implemented a small [app using Go, Gin, Pgx, Zap, Viper and Testcontainers](https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/bookmarks-go).
* Published a video on [Getting Started with Testcontainers for Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbV31aE-asU)
* I am not using Chat GPT much myself. I am interested to see how we can use it, so gonna watch [Building Java Stuff with ChatGPT - Episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2wXog37PXY)

Keep learning. Cheers.
