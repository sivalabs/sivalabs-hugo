## What I Learned This Week

* If you are thinking of what is a better way to structure your code, then I highly recommend watching
  [Facts and Myths about CQRS • Oskar Dudycz • Devoxx Poland 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9COWKz1E32w) talk.
* I have updated my blog to make it easy to read posts and optimized CSS/JS to make it a bit faster.
  Along the way, I learned some new features of **Hugo** such as including **Table of Contents**, **opening external links in a new tab**, etc.
* **Spring Boot Tutorials for the Impatient:** I have planned to write concise and to the point tutorials on the latest Spring Boot version.
  I have published [Getting Started with Spring Boot](https://www.sivalabs.in/getting-started-with-spring-boot/) article, 
  which is the first tutorial in the series. So, stay tuned!!
* Published [Testing REST API integrations using WireMock and Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/guides/testing-rest-api-integrations-using-wiremock/) guide.
* I have published [Creating a Blog using Hugo, Asciidoc, and Netlify](https://www.sivalabs.in/creating-blog-using-hugo-asciidoc-netlify/) article
  which you can follow to create your blog with **ABSOLUTELY ZERO COST**.
* **AtomicJar** team announced [Testcontainers desktop app](https://testcontainers.com/desktop/) to make local development simpler using [Testcontainers](https://testcontainers.com/). Check it out.

## A happy moment
One of my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/sivalabs) subscribers pinged me and said he was looking for Job change, and my [Top 5 Tips to succeed in Technical Interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNf512h5bnU) helped him a lot.
That made me feel the time and effort of making videos is worth it :smile:
