Maven is a good project management tool which&nbsp;greatly&nbsp;reduces the amount of time we spend on creating java projects with proper structure.&nbsp;With so many&nbsp;predefined&nbsp;maven archetypes it is even easier to create projects by simply selecting the archetype based on the technologies we need and type(jar/war/ear) of project we want to create.

However sometimes those predefined archetypes structure may not suite well for our needs or we may need some more additions to the pre-configured dependencies/frameworks etc.

Also in Eclipse the default java compiler level is 1.5 and configuring it to 1.6&nbsp;every time&nbsp;is frustrating.  
So I thought of creating some custom archetypes for the most common combination of technologies/frameworks that I frequently use.

Yes, I am aware of **AppFuse** which provides lot more maven archetypes. But the structure I follow is a bit different, so I thought of creating archetypes which suites my needs/style ðŸ™‚

Most of my projects are Spring based applications, so I have created the following templates so far:

**1. Quickstart Java App :&nbsp;**  
A Simple Java Application with JDK 1.6, SLF4J(Logback/Log4J) and failsafe plugin configuration.

**2. Quickstart Web App:**  
A Simple Web Application with JDK 1.6, Servlet 2.5, SLF4J(Logback/Log4J) and failsafe plugin configuration.

**3. Quickstart Spring App:&nbsp;**  
A Java project with Spring 3.1.x, MySQL, JdbcTemplate and Log4j/Logback configuration.

**4. Quickstart SpringMVC App:&nbsp;**  
A Web project with SpringMVC 3.1.x,MySQL, JdbcTemplate, jQuery and Log4j/Logback configuration.

**5. Quickstart SpringMVC-Tiles-SpringSecurity App:&nbsp;**  
A Web project with SpringMVC 3.1.x, Apache Tiles, SpringSecurity 3.1.x, jQuery and Log4j/Logback configuration.

**6. Quickstart SpringMVC-SiteMesh-SpringSecurity App:&nbsp;**  
A Web project with SpringMVC 3.1.x, SiteMesh 2.x, SpringSecurity 3.1.x, jQuery and Log4j/Logback configuration.

**7. Quickstart SpringMVC-JPA2(Hibernate) App:**  
A Web project with SpringMVC 3.1.x, JPA2(Hibernate4.x), SpringDataJPA, Apache Tiles, jQuery, SpringSecurity and Log4j/Logback configuration.

**8. Quickstart SpringMVC-MyBatis App:**  
A Web project with SpringMVC 3.1.x, MyBatis, jQuery and Log4j/Logback configuration.

**9. Quickstart Spring-JSF2(PrimeFaces)-JPA2(Hibernate) App:**  
A Web project with Spring 3.1.x, JSF2(PrimeFaces), JPA2(Hibernate),SpringDataJPA and Log4j/Logback configuration.

These are the archetypes so far I have completed and uploaded them onto my GitHub repository <https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/maven-archetype-templates>

**I have mentioned how to install them in your local repository in README file.**

I am planning for writing some more template archetypes including SpringRESTFul Services, Spring-ApacheCXF App, Spring Integration, Spring-JavaEE6 etc.  

Stay tuned ðŸ™‚<
