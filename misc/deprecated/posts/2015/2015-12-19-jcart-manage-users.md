In our previous post 
[JCart: Manage Roles]({{< relref "2015-12-19-jcart-manage-roles.md" >}}) 
we have seen how to list all roles, create new roles and update them.

Implementation of **Manage Users** also follows the same approach and very similar to the Implementation of Manage Roles. So I am not posting details of the implementation here again. Instead you can simply refer the code on JCart github repository [https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart](https://github.com/sivaprasadreddy/jcart).

If you have any questions regarding the implementation of Manage Users please post a comment.

With this we have Iteration-2 tasks completed. We will start on Iteration-3 soon. Stay tuned ðŸ™‚
